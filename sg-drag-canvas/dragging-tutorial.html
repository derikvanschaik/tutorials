        <h1>Dragging custom widgets on PySimpleGUI graph objects</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>In some PySimpleGUI applications using the 
           Graph object, we may have widgets on a certain
           graph which have the ability to be selected in 
           order to perform certain operations. Examples of such
           operations which I coded into <span><a href="#">MIMI</a></span>
           were:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Change the color of the selected widget</li>
            <li>Delete the selected widget</li>
            <li>Connect selected widgets</li> 
            <li>Change fonts</li>
            <li>Change font sizes</li>
            <li>Update text within widget</li> 
        </ul>
        <p> All this requires that there be 
           a toggling of a 'selected property' that occurs when the 
           user clicks on that widget. Here is a demo of a small application
           which demonstrates this: 
           <br>
        </p>
        <img src = "gifs/pre-tutorial-canvas.gif" />
        <br>
        <p>
            Here is the starter code for the application you see above: 
        </p>
    </div>
        <pre> 
        <code class="python">    
import PySimpleGUI as sg

def main():
    bott_left, top_right, centre = (0,0), (100,100), (50,50) 
    canvas = sg.Graph(
        (500, 500), bott_left, top_right, key='CANV',
        background_color='white',
        enable_events = True, 
            )
    output = sg.Text("", key="OUTPUT", size=(50, 1))   
    layout = [[output], [canvas]]
    window = sg.Window('draggable graph application', layout)
    # global event variables 
    figs = {} #key will be pysimple gui, maps to dict with 'selected' property 
    while(True):
        event, values = window.read()

        if event == "CANV": 
            click_location = values[event]
            # for else loop being used here 
            for figure in canvas.get_figures_at_location(click_location):
                # user clicked on present object 
                if figure in figs:
                    # toggle selected property 
                    figs[figure]['selected'] = not figs[figure]['selected']
                    # just some output text to let us know something is happening 
                    window['OUTPUT'].update(f"figure {figure} selected = {figs[figure]['selected']}")
                    break

                fig_id = canvas.draw_circle(click_location, radius = 5, fill_color = 'blue')
                figs[fig_id] = {'selected': False}
                # just some output text to let us know something is happening 
                window['OUTPUT'].update(f"Just created figure {fig_id}") 

        if event in(None, sg.WIN_CLOSED):  
            break 

    window.close()

         <h2>The Problem: </h2>
        <p>
            An issue arises when we expect this behaviour to persist while trying to integrate 
            'dragging' into our application by enabling drag submits. 
        </p>
     </div>
     <pre>
         <code class="python">
# main canvas 
canvas = sg.Graph(
    (500, 500), bott_left, top_right, key='CANV',
    background_color='white',
    enable_events = True, drag_submits = True # added this param
    )

         </code>
     </pre>
     <div class="blog-writing">
        <p>
            When this parameter is set to true, a click will fire the canvas event twice.
            This then poses a problem for our toggling as it will be toggled on and then toggled 
            off each event handle essentially undoing the toggle after a single click. Notice 
            How below the event 'CANV' (the key which we passed into for our canvas/graph object) 
            appears twice after every 'CANV+UP' event. This is the undesired behaviour.<br>
            <span><i>Note that the 'CANV+UP' event is equivalent to a mouseup event. </i></span> 
        </p>
        <img src="gifs/drag-submits-problem.png"/>
        <p>
            So now we lose this toggling of selected property behaviour and it becomes
            very difficult to discern wether the user is dragging, clicking or selecting
            which will in turn make our application's code more complex to handle each event. 
        </p>
        <h2>A Solution:</h2>
        <p>
            Who says we need one graph? Why not have one graph for our 
            selecting and all those events associated with selecting, and have
            another graph for dragging? 
        </p> 
    </div>
    <pre>
        <code class="python">
# main canvas 
canvas = sg.Graph(
    (500, 500), bott_left, top_right, key='CANV',
    background_color='white',
    enable_events = True, 
        )
# drag canvas - drag_submits parameter set to true 
drag_canvas = sg.Graph(
    (500, 500), bott_left, top_right, key='DRAG-CANV', 
    background_color='white',
    enable_events = True, drag_submits= True 
        )
        </code>
    </pre>

    <div class="blog-writing"> 
        <p>Now we create an event handler for when user is dragging onto our newly added drag canvas.</p>
    </div>
    <pre>
        <code class="python">
if event == "DRAG-CANV":
    # just some output text to let us know something is happening
    drag_location = values[event] 
    window['OUTPUT'].update(f"USER is dragging on drag canvas at {drag_location}")

    <div class="blog-writing">
        <p>
            Our application now looks like so:
        </p>
        <img src = "gifs/double-canvas-init.gif" width="700"/>
        <p>
            Any figure which is created on the main canvas must obviously
            be drawn onto the secondary or draggable canvas so that when the 
            user wishes to drag that widget they will do so for the corresponding
            widget on the draggable canvas. This goes under the main canvas event handler after 
            the for else loop.  
        </p>
    </div>
    <pre>
        <code class="python"> 
# create figure to be drawn onto drag canvas 
drag_fig_id = drag_canvas.draw_circle(click_location, radius = 5, fill_color = 'blue')
        </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="blog-writing">
        <p>
            The more subtle fact is that now any time we select a figure on the drag
            canvas and do our operation with that widget (which in this case is a drag operation)
            we must do so with our main widget at that location onto the main canvas. We must too
            do anything that we do to our main widget to our corresponding drag widget. 
            We then have a one to one relationship between these widgets like so: 
        </p>
        <img src="gifs/figure-relationship.png">
        <p>
            The simplest way we can achieve this is through a dictionary
            where we map both ids to eachother.
            Declare the following about the event loop: 
        </p>
    </div>
    <pre>
        <code class="python"> 
twin_tracker = {} # maps canvas objects to drag canvas objects and vice versa 
        </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="blog-writing">
        <p>
            Finally after creating both figures on their respective canvases, 
            map both ids to eachother within our new dictionary. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <pre>
        <code class="python"> 
# create figure to be drawn onto drag canvas 
drag_fig_id = drag_canvas.draw_circle(click_location, radius = 5, fill_color = 'blue')
# map figures to eachother 
twin_tracker[fig_id] = drag_fig_id
twin_tracker[drag_fig_id] = fig_id 
</code>
    </pre>
    <div class="blog-writing">
        <p>Here is our application now:</p>
        <img src="gifs/double-canvas-figure-creating.gif" width = "700"/> 
        <p>
        <p> 
            We have already implemented one direction of this two way relationship as 
            when we draw an object onto our canvas it does so to both canvases. 
            Now we need it so when the user drags a widget on the drag canvas, it relocates its corresponding widget
            on the other canvas to the location the user dragged to.
            One addition to the code we have already was to add a 'location' property to the figure on main canvases'
            object reference (or dictionary) when creating objects onto the main canvas.
        </p> 
    </div>
    <pre>
        <code class="blog-writing">
figs[fig_id] = {'selected': False, 'location': click_location}
        </code>
    </pre>
    <div class = "blog-writing">
            Now, here is the implementation of the dragging feature underneath the drag on canvas event handler
            we already set up earlier:
            <i>Notice how easy it was to access the corresponding widget thanks to our twin tracker dict.</i>
        </p>
    </div>
    <pre>
        <code class="python">  
if event == "DRAG-CANV": 
    # drag location x and y 
    (x, y) = values[event]
    # threshold for fig drags (hotspot)
    thresh = 5 
    for fig_id, fig_obj  in figs.items():
        fig_x, fig_y = fig_obj['location']
        # user is dragging this figure 
        if (abs(x-fig_x) <= thresh and abs(y-fig_y) <= thresh):
            canvas.relocate_figure(fig_id, x, y)
            drag_canvas.relocate_figure( twin_tracker[fig_id], x, y)
            fig_obj['location'] = (x, y) # reset new location
            break  
        </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="blog-writing">
        <p>Application after our dragging implementation.
            Note that we can now toggle and drag, which is what we initally set out to do!
            Fantastic. 
        </p>
        <img src="gifs/double-canvas-dragging.gif" width="700" /> 
        <p> 
            Now that we have achieved what we initially set out to do (drag widgets on our canvas), 
            all that remains is to hide this double canvas implementation to our poor and confused user. Double canvases?
            Which one is which? WAAAHH. Yeah, no bueno. We must hide the ugly truth in favour of a more idealized version of reality from our poor and naive user. Luckily enough PySimpleGUI makes
            this super easy with the Tab and TabGroup elements, specifically thanks to the tab's visibility property which can be 
            easily updated. We put each canvas into their own tab, titling the tab (the first param of the sg.Tab object) appropriately.
            I chose "dragging on" and "dragging off". Then we hide the "dragging on tab" by setting its visibility parameter to false. 
        </p>
    </div> 
    <pre>
        <code language="python">
# wrap each canvas into a tab 
main_tab = sg.Tab("dragging off", [[canvas]]) 
drag_tab = sg.Tab("dragging on", [[drag_canvas]], visible=False) # dragging tab is invisible 
# create tab group 
tabs = sg.TabGroup([[main_tab, drag_tab]]) 

        </code> 
    </pre>

    <div class="blog-writing">
        <p>
            Now our application hides the double canvas implementation from our user. However at our application's current state, 
            we have no way of getting to our draggable canvas as it's tab is now hidden and only displays our main canvas.
        </p>
        <img src="gifs/one-tab-canvas-no-toggle.gif" /> 
        <p>
            We need to allow our user to go into and out of 'drag mode' in order 'flip' tabs and display its corresponding canvas.
            We will do this with the use of a button. 
            When the user clicks this button they will enter drag_mode or exit drag_mode depending on what the said variable was prior to 
            clicking this button. Instead of cluttering/polluting our event handler with another global variable we will take 
            advantage of the metadata property that Button elements have in PySimpleGUI. This metadate property will be our drag mode variable.  
        </p>

    </div>

    <pre>
        <code class="python">  
# create drag mode toggler button 
# set metadata parameter to false. True -> in drag mode False -> not in drag mode 
mode_toggler = sg.Button("toggle drag mode", metadata=False ) 
        </code>
    </pre>

    <div class = "blog-writing" >
        Of course we must pack these newly created elements into our layout.  
    </div>
    <pre>
        <code class="python"> 
layout = [[output, mode_toggler], [tabs]]
window = sg.Window('draggable graph application', layout)
        </code>
    </pre> 
    <div class="blog-writing">
        <p>
            Finally, we need to write the event handler code for when the user toggles the drag mode. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <pre>
        <code class="python"> 
if event == "toggle drag mode":
    # toggle drag mode 
    mode_toggler.metadata = not mode_toggler.metadata 
    dragging = mode_toggler.metadata 
    # toggle visibility properties of tabs -- only show one at a time 
    window['dragging on'].update( visible = dragging) 
    window['dragging off'].update( visible = not dragging)
    # select original canvas if not in dragging mode. 
    if not dragging:
            window['dragging off'].select()  
        </code>
